[Enflasyon Sepetim](https://enflasyon.shinyapps.io/sepetim/) is a web application that allows Turkish consumers—many of whom are skeptical of official inflation rates and seek alternative sources—
to calculate their customized inflation rate. I scrape daily prices for a wide range of goods from major grocery store websites, and the application enables users to specify their basket to determine their personalized inflation rate.
